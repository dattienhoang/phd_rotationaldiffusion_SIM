This code simulates the random walk of a vector on a sphere. To make the situation analogous 
to the rotation of flourescent guest molecules in a supercooled liquid host, two 'microscope images' 
are generated by composing their vector position into their x,y components (analogous to 
decomposing to s,p polarizations).

The top level program is 'basicrotsim_20150205.pro'. Parameters for generating the random walk are
set in the top level program. THe parameters for applying noise are in 'brs_noise_20150205.pro'
so that noise effects on the same trajectories can be tested.
