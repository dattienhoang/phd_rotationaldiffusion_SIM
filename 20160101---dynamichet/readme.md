# phd_rotationaldiffusion_SIM/20160101---dynamichet/

two different implementations of (similar) simulations for dynamically heterogeneous rotation. these two
simulations are in two separate folders respectively...:
- cpp_ks: Dr Kevin. Stokely's version in C++
- idl_dth: Dt. Dat Tien Hoang's version in IDL
